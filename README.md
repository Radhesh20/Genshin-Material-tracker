# Genshin Material Tracker

Genshin Material Tracker is a web application built to helps to keep track of your Genshin Impact materials and collection progress. It's a beautiful and easy-to-use tool for managing your in-game items. 

Full disclosure I have only created this for my use and because of my boredome and I know there interactive map for these. Reason I made this is when i was collecting material fro my dendroculus resonance stone i got so fed up to check again and again my inventory, thats all.

This application is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and it uses local storage to save your data.

## Features

  - **Add, Edit, and Delete Materials:** Easily add new materials you want to track, edit their details, or delete them from your list.
  - **Track Progress:** For each material, you can set the amount you need and track the amount you've collected.
  - **Increment/Decrement Collected Amount:** Quickly update the collected amount with "+1", "+5", "-1", and "-5" buttons.
  - **Progress Bar:** A visual progress bar for each material shows you how close you are to your goal.
  - **Pagination:** If you have a long list of materials, the app will paginate them for easier viewing.
  - **Local Storage:** Your material list is saved in your browser's local storage, so your data will be there when you come back.
